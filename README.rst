This repository contains two subprojects that demonstrate building of Daml client applications with the usage of Java Bindings:

- `Ping-Pong  <PingPong>`_ is a collection of three examples that shows how a Java application would use the `Java Binding library <https://docs.daml.com/app-dev/bindings-java/index.html>`_ to connect to and exercise a Daml model running on a ledger
- `Stock Exchange <StockExchange>`_ shows an advanced use-case of the Java bindings for building a Daml client application that leverages off-ledger data distribution by using `Explicit Contract Disclosure <https://docs.daml.com/app-dev/explicit-contract-disclosure.html>`_
